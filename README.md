# Data Visualizations with python.
A personal project that focuses on a dataset, "Telco Customer Churn," extracted from Kaggle, contains valuable information about customers of a telecommunications company and whether they have ended their service (churned). With 7,043 customer records and 21 columns, including demographics, account history, and payment details, it provides a comprehensive overview for analyzing customer behavior and predicting churn.

Key Features:
- **Customer Churn**: The main focus of this dataset is the binary variable "Churn," which indicates whether a customer has churned or not.
- **Demographics**: The dataset includes demographic information such as gender, age range, and other relevant customer characteristics.
- **Services**: Information about the type of internet service provided to customers is available, enabling analysis of the relationship between service type and churn.

Primary Objectives:
1. Determine the Percentage of Churned Customers: Calculate the proportion of customers who have churned versus those who remain in active service.
2. Analyze Churn Patterns by Gender: Visualize any patterns or trends in customer churn based on gender.
3. Examine Churn Patterns by Service Type: Create visual representations to identify any relationships between customer churn and the type of services provided.
4. Identify the Most Profitable Services: Utilize visualizations to highlight the services that generate the highest profitability.
